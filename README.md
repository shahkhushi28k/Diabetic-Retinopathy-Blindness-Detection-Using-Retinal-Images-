**Problem Statement :**
Millions with diabetes risk blindness from Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). 
Current methods lack accessibility and speed, leaving early detection gaps. 
This project builds an AI-powered system using retinal images for accurate, automated Diabetic Retinopathy stage detection, aiming to improve accessibility, save sight, and empower better healthcare.


**Introduction :**
Diabetic Retinopathy is caused by the damage to the blood vessels of light sensitive tissue at the back of an eye(retina).
Diabetic Retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss among working-age diabetic adults, characterized by damage to the blood vessels in the retina due to high blood sugar levels.
The condition can develop in anyone who has Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes.
If an individual has been living with diabetes for an extended period without controlling their blood sugar levels, they may experience complications with their eyes.


**Proposed Solution:**
Leveraging deep learning, computer vision, and image processing, we've developed a system that accurately analyzes retinal images to identify different stages of the disease. 
System allows user to upload videos of retina which are taken by slit lamp lens approach , potentially classify stages .
This innovative solution has the potential to improve patient outcomes significantly by enabling early detection and timely treatment, ultimately safeguarding precious eyesight.
